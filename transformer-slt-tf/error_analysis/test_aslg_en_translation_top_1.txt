-3.955485 ||| at the start of the constitutional process of rules are that every country has to ratify or it falls .
-2.462039 ||| if we wish is to become a reality , we need to assist and cooperate with croatia .
-0.773582 ||| we are all anxious to see this .
-1.442510 ||| this is all about the common foreign and security policy .
-1.649355 ||| unfortunately , that is not the case and now he has suffered the same fate as his predecessor .
-1.568608 ||| ladies and gentlemen , the report reached we from haiti is shocking .
-0.866815 ||| we must approach our own with the same sense of responsibility and realism .
-0.674014 ||| the european union has a major role to play .
-0.795161 ||| it is immeasurable .
-0.386610 ||| how and when will it be provided ?
-1.726580 ||| it seems that not only is there no financial clarification , but there is also no political clarification .
-1.724862 ||| this is especially true its uniform and balanced approach to the union's enlargement policy .
-1.651851 ||| turning , now , to the individual areas in more detail
-2.796246 ||| everyone essentially agreed to the principles of paying true costs .
-0.331345 ||| i doubt that .
-1.690734 ||| this is a direct question asked by mr bokros .
-2.134644 ||| parliament will be informed at early stage of staffing changes in the commission .
-1.285914 ||| i believe that we should not remain idle on this transit issue .
-3.881604 ||| madam president , I think the three institutions have made their viewpoint in this debate very clear .
-2.146486 ||| the choice of what to do and what not to do will be in the hands of individual companies .
-1.513883 ||| citizens , like their politicians , want to be able to travel freely .
-1.771022 ||| colleagues have spoken about unprecedented flooding that took place in ireland at a weekend .

-1.166312 ||| there is an improvement in 2009 in this regard .
-1.860146 ||| this is a democratic procedure ending in the vote .
-1.692029 ||| i therefore think that reference to romania and bulgaria was used without taking into consideration the entire context .
-0.340890 ||| thank you for listening .
-0.744351 ||| iran the shirin ebadi case
-1.994758 ||| indeed , the cohesion policy is actually the best instrument for mobilising investment in growth and employment .

-4.460977 ||| moreover , its audience is clearly evident .
-1.544943 ||| you are speaking in the free parliament .
-0.934212 ||| in addition to that , I should like to thank the secretariat for its work .
-2.250679 ||| parliament report regarding the reception situation appears to be completely ineffective .

-3.274710 ||| we presented a difference with the government of iran is many of some are very serious .
-2.684342 ||| these are conditions that have led to a crisis for jobs seekers in europe .
-6.051358 ||| i submit a number of amendments to the committee , which is dealt with relatively involved by the rapporteur .
-1.829741 ||| two came years will be difficult .

-0.357540 ||| let us not waste it .
-9.104190 ||| concerning the mediterranean , we have the object to east that only talks about security .
-0.944223 ||| i am very aware of the complexity of this issue , mr kelly .
-1.266480 ||| this is a crucial issue for democracy and I think that the president of parliament should defend it .
-0.467881 ||| why is this ?
-10.211425 ||| i am sorry that accidental was lost elections .
-0.525488 ||| no , they should not have to do so .
-2.317006 ||| the commission should cooperate with parliament and member states , not dictate to them .

-2.422131 ||| such policy orientation is indeed part of an integrated policy guidelines adopted by the european council .
-0.586140 ||| this is one of our top priority .
-2.864235 ||| third , what is the timeframe for relaxing the visa restriction ?
-2.412739 ||| i congratulate president , since he was presented at the european council meeting .
-4.423022 ||| it is not an condition of this debate .
-1.824462 ||| the swedish presidency is seeking to speed up the capitalist restructuring , within the framework of the lisbon strategy .
-6.131758 ||| the belgian authorities have requested eur 6.9 million from the fund in this regard .

-2.181740 ||| in future , we need a fair trade , not merely trade that is , in principle , free .
-2.895666 ||| however , imagine that you have been one negotiating partner on the other side .
-6.648224 ||| this has been on back dangerously for long while , and there are reasons for that .
-0.208243 ||| before the final vote
-0.683117 ||| what is the mediterranean diet ?
-2.814975 ||| firstly , assistance for national governments with transpose directives .
-3.945930 ||| neither is it the case that the presidency wishes to unnecessarily restricted insight or debates in any respect .
-0.793034 ||| it is difficult to have peace without democracy .
-0.210803 ||| thank you .
-2.655840 ||| these obstacles , which are due to bureaucratic difficulties and complex , vague procedures , lead to mistakes .
-2.268574 ||| the commission is already prepared for such negotiations , which are expected to start within the next few months .
-11.062222 ||| tunisia also rightly took preparing an approach to islamist jihadi extremism .

-1.507114 ||| this evaluation is a prerequisite for any legislative initiative on matters .
-3.376095 ||| the first is to maintain the support measures until the recovery has been consolidated .
-1.011956 ||| are all parties able and willing to work for peace ?
-1.909257 ||| the text as adopted today in this plenary does not offer sufficient guarantees to this effect .
-2.903924 ||| if there are any doubts , his statement is there on the importance of the draft treaty of lisbon .
-0.707868 ||| the first concerns the commission's discharge .
-2.035075 ||| however , this does not mean that we agree with or applaud the whole content of the green paper .
-1.568267 ||| however , prevention is also important alongside providing best possible care for those affected .

-4.793743 ||| i say this entirely without irony .
-1.439159 ||| nevertheless , I would like to thank you for the last six months .
-1.834563 ||| that is why we must discuss the financing of investment in developing countries .
-1.794803 ||| if they are to occur again , we would have to finance them from the agricultural budget .
-4.079461 ||| have you ever played russian roulette ?
-0.364549 ||| we expect the same today .
-1.152677 ||| the commission has yet to even considered this solution .
-1.068842 ||| this is a question for the commission and the council .
-0.409401 ||| this is very important .
-2.970975 ||| madam president , when farm women started protests you know there are serious difficulties .

-1.580984 ||| for this reason , I am in favour of controls , but different kinds .
-2.866624 ||| at the council of many member states have also voiced concerns about the proposal .

-1.510780 ||| there are also significant disparities among these areas in individual member states .
-2.242667 ||| i believe that can only be done if agriculture is , to certain extent , re nationalise .
-2.060126 ||| we must , however , keep communication channels to outside the world open .
-1.060294 ||| the economy cannot take priority over people's safety .

-1.108607 ||| i urge that on three institutions represent here today and on the house .
-7.315322 ||| as a quality of the rapporteur , I greatly cherish this competitive edge that our european products has .
-5.560163 ||| that is not in the interests of fact .
-1.838748 ||| i am very much in favour of establishing a strategic partnership with this major economic players .
-1.362476 ||| the european union has done an excellent work as regards protecting and strengthening consumer rights and health .
-2.176154 ||| this , in turn , will reduce the costs and lead to lower prices .
-0.690875 ||| i now move to more specific questions .
-15.009553 ||| in its proposal , parliament investing and increases expenditure substantially compared with 200at the same time , we must bear in mind that the ides of mind that the recession .
-0.435977 ||| we must now return to it .

-1.331929 ||| madam president , can I remind you that this would not have happened to mr schulz .
-2.203186 ||| one thing is therefore certain , namely that basel rules need to be developed further .
-1.988830 ||| the system of monitoring therefore requires greater supervision .
-1.311492 ||| the second will be one ambition .
-3.036343 ||| however , this is a short term measure which will not resolve the problem of disappearing jobs .
-0.783087 ||| are we also going to agree to that ?
-2.445823 ||| the second is an improvement in the conditions under which people live .
-0.403326 ||| the sitting was suspended at 12.00 and resumed at 15.00
-0.617963 ||| i therefore clearly voted in favour of this report .

-1.561141 ||| mr president , the eastern partnership is a project which covers six countries .
-0.357784 ||| the debate is closed .
-6.087831 ||| in view of such obscene assessment , how can this house approved such a budget ?
-3.288427 ||| furthermore , some countries have adjusted their exchange rates and introducing other mechanisms to become competitive in our markets .
-2.519091 ||| for this , I can but give high praise to our rapporteurs , mr schlyter .
-7.961177 ||| i therefore implore that we get off trampling these decisions .
-0.534609 ||| the next item is the vote .
-3.396910 ||| many victims of trafficking are unable to speak chinese and be held as a virtual prisoner .
-0.860439 ||| so the question of multiple discrimination is not being neglected .
-3.153291 ||| what is needed is coordination , responsibility and decision making facilities , all at european union level .
-2.886526 ||| we therefore voted against the report and in favour of referring proposals back to the commission .
-0.079661 ||| applause
-1.424654 ||| it is not the case that we and the european union agreed on every area .

-3.215480 ||| i abstained on an bullmann report .
-0.601009 ||| how many russian security officials are punished for these crimes ?
-3.655564 ||| until around april last year , economic activity is a decline , months after months .
-1.125933 ||| we must say this quite clearly and we must introduce clear controls .
-0.766965 ||| so this is what we will do in the near future .
-3.057750 ||| today we must take responsibility for the speed things up in order to face the crisis head on .
-1.145156 ||| in wales , the key has been to take a pragmatic approach .
-2.061812 ||| one of the main conditions for voting on the report is thereby meeting .
-0.774320 ||| not today , not tomorrow , but there will be room .
-0.849821 ||| i hope it will also be like this in other cases .

-1.000546 ||| these proposals underline that underline that
-1.289171 ||| we must raise awareness that monetary crisis may have serious political consequences .
-1.068327 ||| we would find that regrettable , because we genuinely believe that action needs to be taken relatively quickly here .
-3.678684 ||| i think that this is a shocking example of how closing the opposite political extreme can become .
-1.361516 ||| energy savings for energy efficient buildings average 30 % over conventional buildings .
-1.648812 ||| we do consult industry and consumers on that .
-1.403922 ||| the motion is quite right to refer to him .

-1.665577 ||| however , we do oppose this legislation is made at eu level .
-2.784382 ||| this relates both to the european development fund and ana mechanisms .
-3.211580 ||| whatever view in this parliament , I think people has to face up to that as well .

-4.614130 ||| we also know that those who violate the growth and stability pact is the eurozone countries .
-4.170472 ||| just enter into classic blame the games does not help civilians .
-1.791722 ||| it is undoubtedly a good idea to tackle the problem in order of severity .
-0.835737 ||| if nothing else , the rapporteur's report recognises the problem .
-1.147541 ||| is it really necessary that they should have to risk their lives ?
-3.171723 ||| therefore , I would not involve the role of the lisbon treaty .
-3.715297 ||| all 19 romania's minorities are represented in parliament .
-0.435070 ||| europe's role is a coordinated role .
-1.586232 ||| i think it is not necessary to respond to some of the attacks .
-0.656603 ||| i think that we have done too little , too late .
-2.431886 ||| to demand that criminal our embargo against cuba is lifted immediately .

-2.233387 ||| the copenhagen agreement , which provides neither an ambitious objective nor commitment , is unsatisfactory results .
-2.501935 ||| i believe that the position presented in the proposal for a directive is correct .

-0.252931 ||| opening of the sitting
-5.142693 ||| fr mr president , the precautionary principle has become a principle of sweets .
-0.357784 ||| the debate is closed .
-0.880334 ||| fortunately , we will no longer have to address these issues with you in the next parliamentary term .
-1.931150 ||| i believe that measures that we have taken be sufficient .
-1.270804 ||| fortunately in our resolution we recognise that china has a role to play .

-2.144990 ||| i want also to emphasise what we have achieved for consumers in the context of a universal service directive .
-1.968168 ||| can you point to single eu policy which is half as successful as the internet ?
-0.982337 ||| the portuguese government has already decided to make eur 100 million available for this purpose .
-1.687240 ||| this is the best way to stop speculation and to give genuine investor confidence instead .
-1.331574 ||| the next item is the commission statement on the pharmaceutical products package .
-1.186271 ||| i am wondering whether it would be possible to target this vulnerable group under that fund

-0.922848 ||| fifth , we have specific conditions concerning meat production and storage .
-2.308275 ||| in recent days , the vicious circle of violence in the middle east has continued .
-0.321189 ||| we know how important .
-2.045400 ||| allow me to start by saying that my group thinks this is a very good report .
-0.819535 ||| why , though , is it time to act ?
-2.286883 ||| it is , in fact , unreasonable to changes of general rules to suit specific cases .
-2.364900 ||| i have assumed that this parliament is capable of understood the current situation in the world .
-1.460224 ||| yes , we need better supervision and better regulation of the financial markets .
-7.333338 ||| in this regard , the eu has noted with concerns the continuing suspension of media , including antifer international .
-2.695711 ||| i can , of course , provide you with a lot of numbers if need .
-1.790818 ||| the money is continuing to flow nevertheless and in ever higher amounts .
-0.728819 ||| that is highly complex and very difficult .
-1.324692 ||| we need to coordinate member states practices in order to increase trust .

-1.160904 ||| his merit of our full recognition .
-1.102645 ||| it is not enough just to focus cooperation on improving the economic situation .
-3.618541 ||| given recent history of my country I have focused in particular on the tragedy of totalitarian communist rules .
-1.478333 ||| the second key aspect is of humanitarian aid .

-1.983965 ||| in that way , we will be guaranteed uniform high level of safety .
-1.011976 ||| for this , we need a strong europe .
-0.657891 ||| i would ask you all to remember that in today's vote .
-2.954831 ||| regretfully , I have to say that the situation has worsen since our last debate .
-1.538088 ||| therefore , much work needs to be done in order to further simplify the rules .

-1.450681 ||| i should like to end by saying what help our diversity will strengthen our identity .
-1.434540 ||| the most important thing is passenger safety and protection .
-2.545348 ||| that is a plea I made that europe should again turn more its attention to these countries .

-5.821444 ||| madam president , we have survived the cold involved here , in this chamber .
-0.707965 ||| this is a phenomenon that relates to this situation .

-7.306283 ||| posiedzenie zostało otwarte million victims of the 20th century totalitarian regimes in europe .
-0.474452 ||| yet what can stand up to fear ?
-2.669506 ||| on the other hand , we must be aware that there is a number of questions expect answers .
-1.225858 ||| this report is a step in the right direction , which is why I voted for it .
-2.223881 ||| however , one area which I think is also important to we are areas of living .
-2.458329 ||| specific situations of women and girls must also be given full consideration when implementing the un convention .
-0.843065 ||| why are we supporting it ?
-0.460045 ||| allow me to give a few examples .
-2.927828 ||| this therefore confirms the fear of seeing research exports in the wake of these regulations .
-3.010825 ||| the directive sets basic requirements on organisations , management and oversight of investment funds .
-0.284603 ||| written statements rule 149
-0.718089 ||| i do not believe either that there should be a single definition of social housing .

-1.873962 ||| we will be carefully watch the treatment of these issues as their progress .
-2.635697 ||| i have great pleasure in giving the floor to the british prime minister , gordon brown .
-7.557908 ||| in these dark and involve times , the kirilov report may be breath of fresh air .
-0.633627 ||| may I warmly welcome you once again to the european parliament .
-2.897849 ||| what we can see in this situation is sub optimal allocation of portfolios among the commissioner .
-2.277562 ||| it is a fear that the number of victims could increase .
-0.315989 ||| today or tomorrow .
-2.375535 ||| our european therefore has the right to tell others not to take that path .
-4.362893 ||| we need this to prove that multiannual control systems working and to mitigate the effects of errors detected .

-2.768003 ||| if there are not well functioning democratic institutions in such situations , things can go seriously wrong .
-1.870035 ||| it would also be right to establish domestic violence and rape within marriages as a criminal offence .
-7.524157 ||| why does code involve the law governing rights of citizens who are not catholic ?
-1.881964 ||| i would like to thank her and wish her all the best for the future .
-1.243701 ||| we are growing increasingly concerned about the progress of the democratisation process in turkey .
-0.539250 ||| so that is the first response .
-0.601867 ||| the summit will cover climate change .
-2.108102 ||| however , the question of source of funding is not enough .
-1.630814 ||| parliament's estimates of revenue and expenditure for financial year 2010

-5.798065 ||| therefore , the limit of eur 50 billion is completely unprotected at present .
-2.061527 ||| borders must be controlled , and the blockade must be lifted .
-2.107051 ||| i believe that the european parliament will also monitor closely in future how these resources are used .
-1.227301 ||| as for gas , we are going to have gas war .
-12.850607 ||| there are reams about clarifying mayors of city of cities and other politicians .

-5.599658 ||| criminal networks that exploit people's minds must be tackled .

-2.925641 ||| barroso lack of vision and political boldness , and this does europe no favour .
-0.621287 ||| it is important to bear this in mind .
-1.248353 ||| mr president , some concrete questions are raised .
-2.127363 ||| it says something about the importance of this and mutual readiness to work in dialogue to find solutions .
-1.144921 ||| mr president , unusual times call for unusual measures .
-1.227758 ||| mr president , I know that there is a great deal of interest in this matter .
-3.379380 ||| thousands of women , children and elderly people are deported and large numbers of women are raped .

-3.066233 ||| i am not sure if their status has gone up of whole pile in the meantime .
-1.281330 ||| that means they also die for europe , since europe without russia is incomplete .
-3.309433 ||| is this way this parliament wants to bring a budget closer to the citizens ?
-1.207324 ||| that is not impunity impunity is to continue as you are for many years .

-0.439766 ||| i would like to thank everyone .
-1.117528 ||| there are complete changes .
-2.739797 ||| there is high risk that financial and real economic crisis might turn into public debt crisis .

-0.151356 ||| loud applause
-0.345109 ||| the president cut off the speaker
-1.383294 ||| we therefore ask the commission last year to propose a framework of european regulation for online gambling .
-2.565059 ||| it is a shame that the biggest political group in this house is no longer reliable negotiating partner .
-2.831395 ||| their point to further falls in the sale of new cars .
-1.441024 ||| i think the task is quite a difficult one .
-3.234309 ||| the proposal that we are examining today therefore seems to be breath of fresh air .
-1.374671 ||| it is simply asking for european supervision for european actors and national supervision for national actors .
-0.357784 ||| the debate is closed .
-1.333571 ||| when is the commission finally going to act ?
-2.710834 ||| the original regional focus of the budget has been replaced by the sectoral approach .
-1.040558 ||| this is a new development that really should be implemented now .
-1.739634 ||| i am pleased that the commission proposal points in that direction .
-2.103333 ||| we must find an optimal solution of appropriate balance between different rules and common requirements .
-1.404498 ||| i draw your attention to this and I hope that the spirit of cooperation will remain .
-1.942869 ||| this very much meets the wishes expressed in the report .
-2.966891 ||| as such , we need to be demanding and ensure that procedures are applied properly .
-1.375579 ||| that will be noted in the minutes .

-1.267552 ||| these two issues which have been raised by two members obviously require scientific opinions , so to speak .
-1.465073 ||| we nevertheless hope that the commission will be in a position to respond to our questions .
-1.836780 ||| the deployment of this mission is not easy to achieve , as you probably observed .
-1.632582 ||| that is , I know , what the new commission is going to strive to achieve with us .
-5.970823 ||| i would boil ask that you abide by speaking time allotted to you .
-1.645918 ||| i would , however , like to put a question to commissioner .
-0.384389 ||| the item is closed .
-0.517262 ||| this is a real improvement .
-0.660069 ||| it is an instrument for all regions .
-14.228623 ||| they are expecting this phobia of the financial market capitalism to be tame and disorientation to be restored .
-1.698276 ||| needless to say , such action will strain financial resources .

-0.228026 ||| transfers of appropriations see minutes
-2.925436 ||| we need promises energy efficiency action plans , promises for so long .
-1.565775 ||| appropriate regulations would be needed for this .
-2.488688 ||| moreover , I think our discussion has also underlined the necessity for both parties to resume dialogue promptly .
-4.711609 ||| i therefore believe that the spanish presidency is right to start by reaffirmed the value of importance of equality .

-0.618017 ||| no one in the chamber has said that .

-1.807488 ||| . care required .
-1.497934 ||| as far as I see it , we will not make any progress this way .
-0.501902 ||| we need true european solidarity .
-0.513296 ||| i believe we all agree on this .
-1.856257 ||| and we should continue to fight on for the final agreement to the treaty of binding treaty .
-2.337449 ||| the text complied completely with the principle of subsidiarity , and it is also fair .
-0.958978 ||| the rules adopted should be implemented .
-1.218727 ||| with respect , your staff indicated that my request has been noted .
-2.825785 ||| the reality shows us that effect this change does not respect borders or geographical areas .

-1.867132 ||| stability in kosovo is maintained throughout the last year's important development .
-1.841919 ||| in other words these measures must not lead to any dramatic long term threat to stability public finances .
-1.229212 ||| it is about doing what many people in this house cannot do and others do not want to do .

-2.293569 ||| each amount to eur 200 million , and this will enable us to achieve cooperation between nations states .
-1.055805 ||| these must remain national matters and therefore , the eu should not go down this route .
-1.057451 ||| this report is actually split into two .
-2.369789 ||| on 22 october 2009 , we adopted a resolution on sis ii and visa information systems .
-0.230454 ||| i agree .
-1.998250 ||| various member states are investing enormous amounts of money in supporting the economy and employment .
-5.933650 ||| however , as it has been a word of involving , we are withdrawn it .
-0.921328 ||| so , what is the reality ?
-1.173689 ||| europol has experienced with data protection rules , and we must assume that this is a good choice .
-10.256598 ||| this proposal never comes , but the stephen rich and I do not give up fighting .
-0.665710 ||| debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law debate

-3.544903 ||| this is exactly why the immediate implementation of our adjusting rules of procedure is not down to parliament either .
-1.269946 ||| i think this piece of legislation will make it appropriate that we have higher standards across the european union .
-5.948046 ||| i am sure that we can supersede the trans european railway corridors networks by 20the sitting are resumed .
-8.607695 ||| i see that you agree with relish involving the catalan .
-0.191580 ||| no .
-1.340630 ||| dear friends , this year , 2009 , is a very significant year for latvia .
-0.308097 ||| that is enough .
-6.095603 ||| i think israel's policy has been regarded by many of us as a liar .
-1.075894 ||| it is up to parliament to make this one of its prerogatives .
-0.286980 ||| written statements rule 142
-1.370495 ||| but I think we need to understand and remember why we have an interim agreement .
-2.665973 ||| as a national state , romania has supported the adoption of the swift agreement .
-1.907244 ||| if europe does not restore its growth path , it will decline economically and will therefore also decline politically .
-0.437191 ||| my question is as follows .
-1.125033 ||| this concerns not only animal health and food safety , but also environmental standards , production and animal welfare .
-1.534747 ||| firstly , we are the revised treaty .
-2.059134 ||| the european commission notes that during 2009 , turkey makes some progress , albeit limits , on political reforms .
-9.688331 ||| we should therefore be very careful about taking documentary than involving an approach when comments on human rights outside the eu .
-0.697270 ||| we are still not happy with what is happening over there .
-0.217278 ||| closure of the sitting
-1.034186 ||| it is a very clear political matter .

-2.534672 ||| the pvv asked itself where this is all heading .
-0.924819 ||| it will be yet another challenge for public finances in many countries of the european union .
-1.062527 ||| i would even have gone further in a few places .
-0.570491 ||| time is short !
-1.556338 ||| today the latest unemployment figure is announced in ireland .
-4.670774 ||| i am really and truly , involving , delighted about this .
-4.105660 ||| the simple irish government is torn a heart out of health services , education , childcare and training .
-1.348543 ||| this is , and also should be , the main objective of creating this office .
-1.337217 ||| i hope that my fellow members from other groups , too , can endorse this proposal .
-0.567712 ||| this is unjust and ineffective .
-5.349698 ||| the first east has already been mentioned by mrs hassi .
-1.636580 ||| people cuba do not enjoy freedom of speech and assembly .
-7.583234 ||| there are also costs in terms of conditions in connection with long journeys .
-1.522534 ||| we have to discuss the social perspective as well .
-1.433999 ||| i would like to say something , although does so will not bring me any satisfaction .
-1.433107 ||| i ask that this honourable house voted for our initiative .
-0.581700 ||| i am sure that the council has taken note of our determination .
-1.573043 ||| i call on my fellow members , the council and the commission to support this .

-1.419757 ||| applause from the left and protests from the right
-2.151268 ||| what is the situation with regard to europe wide certification systems for maintenance work ?
-3.124774 ||| member states should also take appropriate measures to simplify procedures for the issue of visas .
-3.032287 ||| are we really taking to the task of players in the financial markets who have contributed to the crisis ?
-8.485957 ||| aid , gypsies and tb still claims some four million lives years .
-1.382059 ||| therefore , we cannot assume that they are lacking in the knowledge of european law .
-2.595414 ||| this paragraph proposed the creation of an internal market test for all new proposed legislation .
-0.709648 ||| however , I would like to ask for some even more detailed information .

-2.187607 ||| this is especially true at the time when we are in economic recession .
-1.844427 ||| we cannot simply remain a passive spectator .
-6.962121 ||| in most european countries , croupiers by occupation and sector remain almost unchanged .
-2.147650 ||| major producers of co2 include the united states , china , india and brazil .
-1.318125 ||| the next item is the commission statement on the revision of the package travel directive .
-1.264168 ||| it is very important because we have moved from the treaty of nice to the treaty of lisbon .
-1.053958 ||| the disparities between our competences and our financial resources have never been so great .

-0.882846 ||| your confidence and support will help me carry this important task forward .
-2.355991 ||| i do not think that this house needs any remind about the importance of services directive .
-0.497977 ||| it needs a lot of concrete work .
-1.793617 ||| and then we have all these motions on things like what pet we are allowed to take where .
-0.406817 ||| i do not think so .
-1.583397 ||| it can be said that this is one of the most citizens friendly according .

-1.285312 ||| therefore , it is on this point that we must truly take fundamental action .
-0.820708 ||| and remain silent .
-0.589374 ||| we will not vote in favour of it .
-2.951338 ||| i would like to applaud the great professionalism swedish presidency .
-1.560366 ||| i think that there are two parts to this debate .
-2.481066 ||| making a call and resolution does not help civilians .
-2.019245 ||| europe 2020 also means adopting reforms to be implemented within the member states themselves .

-6.242423 ||| decoupling , in my opinion , provides oil that will allow solvency ii to operate more effectively .
-0.613692 ||| its attitude in this matter must therefore be exemplary .
-2.229960 ||| many of our answers , and still answers today , in negative .
-3.061430 ||| that is why I am also proud that by a large majority of our british parliament ratified the lisbon treaty .
-0.994493 ||| my last remark is that we are determined to work with the european parliament .
-2.630644 ||| we cannot simply ignore public opinion and we cannot simply dismissed it as populism .
-2.076932 ||| thanks to the single european sky initiative , a single aviation market has grown and evolved over recent years .

-2.109858 ||| we know that it is not just a question one million signatures on any issue .
-2.393450 ||| however , it seems that , firstly , this requires standardisation of the whole question of orphan works .
-2.693581 ||| ninety per cent of our export and imports are transported via ports .
-1.758830 ||| let us not deceive ourselves russia is not concerned with a few dollars .
